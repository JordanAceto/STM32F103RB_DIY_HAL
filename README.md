## This is a Hardware Abstraction Layer for the STM32F103RB.

### It does not use any of the supplied STM HAL files.

### This is just for goofing around and to learn a little about stm32 microcontrollers and embedded development.
### It is in the very early stages now, more to come.

#### Some acronyms used:
- PSP: Processor Support Package
- BSP: Board Support Package

#### To build and flash the application:
- $ make
- $ make write
